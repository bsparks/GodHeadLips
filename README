You need the Lips of Suna graphics+sound files to run the game currently. Download Lips (any recent release will do), and copy
data/lipsofsuna/graphics and data/lipsofsuna/sounds to GodHead-Lips/data/godhead/graphics and /sounds respectively.
The latest executable requires you follow instructions below on installing the dependencies and compile the source.
A less up-to-date Windows executable and .dll files can be downloaded from the below URL; they go in Godhead-Lips/
