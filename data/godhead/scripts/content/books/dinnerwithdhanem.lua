As the other dinner guests exchanged pleasantries before sitting down Misankyte took careful note of how Lord Dhanem greeted each of them.

 He was a very transparent man, and wicked but not a fool, and Misankyte took great pleasure in figuring out which of the well-clad guests were friends of the Lord and which ones he considered to be foes. 

Ill-masked contempt flickered across his face all too often but, much to Misankyte's amusement, it seemed that all but a select few guests felt the same way about the young Lord, only with more passion. 

His father, the late Lord Massem, had been well respected by the Rhanesian nobility and the well-to-do but Misankyte could not understand how the Rhanesians could find anything worth respecting in a man of his sort. 



Commonly called "Drylords", the Lords of Rhanesia were nought but crooks compared to the chieftains of her home in Hetnia, indulging themselves in wanton sexual acts with prostitutes, and in gambling and in slavery. 

Misankyte had never cared for Rhanesian ethics, or the lack thereof, nor had she found the swampy, flooded and muddy lands to be as beautiful as the Rhanesian emissary had had them believe. 

It was because of that wet, unforgiving terrain that the Lords of Rhanesia had come to be called Drylords. They owned land in the hills and the mountains, lands with ground firm enough to support houses of stone. 

The common people were made to build their houses in wetlands where disease raged rampant between the winter and summer winds, and where buildings would slowly sink into the mud to be swallowed.



People eventually found their seats and toasted to the god of the house and in the honor of the young Lord who had adopted it. 

A costly idol hung suspended over the middle of the table, slowly spinning around as if to appraise or judge each of the guests. 

Misankyte noted that many of the guests would let their eyes fall uncomfortably to their plates when the idol faced them. Dhanem, however, met its gaze with confidence and conceited superiority. 

It was carved from a single piece of some exotic northern wood, adorned in the local blue and red gems that were held in such high esteem in the eastern Borunese Empire.

Dhanem had boasted that the wood was paletree from the Harran Realms, gifted to his father by one of Harran Chroniclers as thanks for some deed Misankyte had paid no attention to. 



The notion was absurd, of course. Misankyte did not know much about the mysterious Harran and their ways but she did know that they protected their fabled white forest with an honor that a Rhanesian man would be unable to comprehend.

She looked at the young Lord seated in front of her. He had seen sixteen summers now, and had grown a lot a since she saw him last year. 

For nine years she had known him. It had been the wishes of Lord Massem and Misankyte's clan that they would marry. He was speaking to a man who had introduced himself as Younes.

He was an aging merchant dressed like a fool. His clothes were so heavily dyed orange and purple that he looked more of a fruit than the successful businessman that he supposedly was. 

Orange and purple were the colors of the poor, the dyes being the most inexpensive on the Rhanesian markets, Misankyte had learned. She found it quite ironic that Younes had spent 
such a considerable amount of dubiously earned money on looking poor, but she did not let her feelings show when he addressed her.



"The good Lord tells me you will be visiting the market tomorrow, my lady. You must make sure to come by and taste my fruits." She smiled at this. "I have just received a fresh shipment from the Freehold. 

They are as ripe as if they were picked in your own garden." He was an amicable enough man, Misankyte thought. He had tried to grow a fist-long beard but it did his face little justice. 

Had he not fallen victim to the desire to mimic the Hetnians, as was fashionable with the well-to-do, he would have been a handsome man. Shy streaks of distinguished 
grey and white hair stretched from his temples back into a neatly kept perfumed braid. He had smelled of roses and his hands had bespoken confidence when he greeted her.

"Only frost grows on the trees of their gardens". The mocking tone of Lord Dhanem's voice turned a few heads in alarm. 

"Cold weathers foster cold women, Younes. It stands to wonder, does it not, if they can bear fruit themselves? Surely, this must be why their women are sent here. Rhanesian seed will grow in the harshest environments."



The men around the table laughed nervously. Some were amused, Misankyte could tell, but many others looked worried as they forced themselves to laugh at the Lord's tasteless impudence. 

She could see anger on the faces of the two guards that accompanied her. She straightened her back and drew her eyebrows together in feigned confusion.

"It would seem to a humble woman as myself that if rhanesian seed would only grow stronger men, your late father would not have had to pay such good money for the sons and daughters of Uleg to guard your chambers at night, my lord." 

She smiled when Lord Dhanem's face went pale, and then an angry red. His lips quivered with conflicting emotions of shame and anger. The dinner guests were silent. Misankyte knew that she had crossed the line. 

Her father would be very upset with her if he found out, and this made her feel shame. She should not be so weak to embarrass her father's good name to protect her own. 



Lord Dhanem looked at her intently, the flaring emotions brought by the insult slowly subsiding to the benefit of that look of puerile arrogance he usually wore on his face. 

It was a handsome face, Misankyte could not deny that for all the disgust she had come to feel for the wicked boy. He would have to take control of the situation and break the awkward and terrified silence or he would look weak. Finally he smiled.

"Lady Misankyte, your humour is most refreshing. My late father loved you dearly. The Uleger can pride themselves in having raised you. I am honored to have you at my table. Will you eat of my bread?" 

He broke off a morsel and offered it to her over the table. She let him wait for a second before she accepted the bread, just long enough for insecurity to show in his eyes.

"And I am honored to dine with you, good Lord Dhanem. May the gods smile upon you and the late Lord Massem." She ate the bread and lifted her cup.

"May we drink in his name."



Dhanem nodded and lifted his cup in response, his face a languid mask now that he had regained his composure. 

The other guests were quick to follow, shouting their approval. The room fell silent for a brief moment as cups of warm spiced wine were lifted to drown the lingering awkwardness. 

Misankyte drank deeply from her cup and closed her eyes as the potent wine burned its way down to her stomach, where it slowly thawed the ices of her own apprehension. I must not succumb to such childish desires. 

She drank again before putting her cup away. Younes smiled at her and she returned the favor.

"You will lend much beauty to this castle, my lady. We are lucky to be honored so."

"You are too kind, my good sir," Misankyte replied and eyed Dhanem cautiously. Pride had flickered across his face. What hollow pride. 



You have done nothing to deserve me. The woman sitting to her left joined the conversation.

"When is the marriage to take place, my lady?" Dhanem had introduced her as Lady Chumen. 

She was one of those that had shown contempt for the lord, but it was well hidden under a facade of feigned inebriation. 

Misankyte had noticed that her cup never seemed to empty. Although she smiled and spoke warmly to the lord, her eyes were burning with a heartfelt disdain. 

She was one of three nobles in the province that now found themselves under the rule of a boy half her age. Misankyte looked at Dhanem, hoping he would answer her question, but he was lost in shallow conversation with a courtesan.



"Lord Dhanem is yet to set a date, but he has assured my father that it will be before the arrival of the winter winds."

 A subtle sneer fluttered over Lady Chumen's lips before she spoke.

"He is wise not to delay the alliance between our province and the Uleger. He will need a strong army to ensure the recognition of the other Lords." Misankyte winced. 

Lady Chumen had been surprisingly candid in her reply but Lord Dhanem showed no signs of having heard. She must have sensed Misankyte's trepidation, 

because she broke into a short laughter and spoke again. "Oh, don't worry, my young friend. Men are so easily distracted." She put her hand on Misankyte's shoulder. 

"It is an interesting man that rules over other men when he cannot command himself."



"My dear Lady Chumen," Misankyte replied after throwing one last careful look at Dhanem. "It is also in our best interest that the alliance is secured in good time. 

The winter will be severe without Rhanesian grain."

Lady Chumen nodded in agreement. They sat still and in silence for a while, Lady Chumen's chair turned to face Misankyte, both taking a swig each from their cups. 

Misankyte saw the faintest hint of a shudder when the dark skinned woman swallowed. This time she drank.



When the flagons and plates had been emptied with voracious appetite the guests moved from the dining hall outside to the lord's terrace. 

It overlooked the late Lord Massem's fantastic and vast garden. Misankyte had many pleasant memories from there. 

Lord Massem had had a sincere love for nature and his garden was a tranquil monument to everything that really was beautiful in Rhanesia. 

Although carefully tended to, in his days, the garden was allowed to grow wild. The pathways in the garden would wind and twist under unkempt trees heavy with fruit and between sprawling bushes overcome with flowers of the most amazing colors. 



Everything seemed to grow where it pleased. On the north side of the garden the walls of the lord's castle merged with the sheer white cliff that the entire town of Bayulsemet seemed to lean against. 

The white cliff was discolored by a small but loud stream of water that trickled down it only to disappear into an impassable thicket of evergreen bushes. When she had been old enough to be allowed to play alone in the garden she had crawled into those bushes to find where the water went. 

Her hair had constantly gotten caught in the bushes and her skin had broken several times but she had been determined. She had crawled on all fours, sometimes flat on her stomach, until she had finally felt the cold water between her fingers. Her dress had been ruined, but she didn't care. She would tell them she had fallen.

The stream had dug a tunnel through the bushes. The branches of small trees stretched over the water to unite in an effort to shield the place from the prying eyes of the adults. 



She had taken off her shoes that first time and walked in the cold water until the stream had fallen off another small precipice and ultimately made its way to the lord's fish pond. 

She had never told anyone of her secret place, but she rarely went there anymore. As she had aged and grown into a woman Dhanem had been giving her less and less time to herself. 

She feared he would follow her, find it and ruin it somehow. Even so, she loved the wild garden.

"We assume so often that the symmetries of man are above those of nature, that ours is order and theirs is disarray," Lord Massem had told Misankyte when she was eight years old. 

It had been her second visit. They had been walking alone in his garden one late evening just before the summer wind had swept in with ominous, thunderous clouds from the south. 



The first early whispers of the tempests to come were already making their way through the trees. 

She pushed an errant strand of black hair behind her ear. She would return to her home in Hetnia the next morning, back to the Uleger clan, away from the wicked boy.

Lord Massem had taken her hand after dinner and invited her to walk with him, alone, in his garden. A rare honor, she knew. The lord never went anywhere without his bodyguards, 

Misankyte's clansmen, and the gesture had moved Misankyte, young though she was. 

She knelt over a patch of red bulbous flowers and carefully monitored a bee. Such curious creatures that kill and spread life.

"Dhanem will be sad to see you go," the lord said and knelt beside her, carefully containing the bee in his cupped hands. 



Misankyte remembered being horrified, angry and awed all at once. She had looked at him for a long time, conflicting emotions vying for her attention as she tried to read his face.

 His skin was darker than hers. He had a thin mouth and thick eyebrows resting carefully on dark brown eyes. A wide nose lent character to his symmetric, angular face. Suddenly his lips tightened and he creased his forehead.

"Did it sting you?" Misankyte asked. Lord Massem slowly opened his hands to reveal the bee. Its stinger was buried in his skin.

She watched in horror as the bee slowly pulled itself free, leaving the stinger behind along with a good part of its body. 



The bee crawled a few more struggling steps into the palm of Lord Massem's hand before falling unto its side, the ever-slowing beat of its wings turning it around in clockwise circles. Misankyte looked on in silence.

"It did". Lord Massem carefully picked it up between two fingers. "And now it will die," he said with a calm voice.

If the stinger still lodged in his hand hurt him he did not let it show.

Misankyte was appalled. "That is not fair! Why must the bee die?"



"It is a noble pursuit, that of liberty, and the bee died for it knowingly. We should be so grateful to have half of its conviction."

 He carefully buried the bee under a mound of earth. "The path to justice is often through violence, my dear Misankyte, and we must not shy from it."

She had thought of Dhanem then, and his violence. There was no justice in it. The young boy took great pleasure in torture and death. 

She remembered vividly the first time she had visited and Dhanem had killed a toad slowly under his foot, or how he had thrown rocks at a young slave girl until Lord Massem had disciplined him. 



She still remembered many horrible things he had done, even to this day. As the years had slowly buried the memories of childhood, and of play, the memories of Dhanem's wickedness would never fade or diminish.

 Like sharp and dangerous cliffs they rose out of the sea of her conscience, always threatening to drown her. How can I ever learn to love this man?

 She sucked hard on her pipe and held her breath, allowing the potent smoke to thrust itself into her welcoming veins like a tide of sensation. 

She vibrated, resonated with the world around her, as the colors of the garden and the dinner guests rose in a crescendo to consume her. 



The garden was pregnant with music, a magnificent roar of harmonies echoing from inside of her. Laughter penetrated her mind.

"It seems Lady Misankyte is quite fond of Leaf," someone said to her left.

She joined the world in laughter and turned her head to nod to the man. The world stretched out into long fingers of vibrant color as she turned her head. 

She turned it again, and then again and laughed with joy until she ran out of air. She lifted her hand to her mouth only to find that someone had taken her pipe. She pouted playfully at a handsome man to her side and he raised his pipe in recognition.




The sun was long set by the time the pipes went out. Misankyte was sitting on the polished marble floor of the terrace, leaning against a baluster, watching the stars. 

She knew all the Ulegi constellations of the summer sky. As a child she had often listened to Mother Sulba's stories of the heroes of old, of Uleg and the Leaving of Anw. The stars bore witness to the greatness of her forefathers, 

she had been told, but she did not need fantastic legends to appreciate the beauty of the night sky. She found comfort in the thought that her brothers and sisters in the north would be watching the same stars as her, their gazes touching Misankyte's in the heavens to soothe the jarring ache of longing. 

She lifted a heavy cup to her lips and sipped carefully on the still warm spiced wine and thought of home. Compared to the majesty of the mountains surrounding the Uleger valley in Hetnia, the spine-like mountains that walled off Rhanesia from Badaurang seemed childlike. 



She thought of the beautiful and clear lake that mirrored the sun at dawn. The cranes would be dancing at its shores soon, shy and gracious, and the bears would venture into their valley to prepare for the coming winter. She would not return to Hetnia and her clan this autumn, though. 

This would be a winter spent without snow and without Wylla. She was Misankyte's only blood sister, born to the same mother three years after Misankyte. They looked much alike, sharing the same large dark brown eyes and the same full lips, often parted slightly in a curious smile. Misankyte loved her dearly and would miss her the most. 



They would not swim in the hot springs together, steam rising from their bodies into the winter air, nor would they huddle up by the fire in the Great Hall and tell each other stories. But even so, the shattering solitude she felt at that moment was of some solace to her, because this winter she would sleep next to Dhanem.

She was not in a hurry to finish her wine. Dhanem had already taken his leave and disappeared with three of his closest friends, leaving the other guests to indulge themselves freely.

 

Many had retired already but a handful were still enjoying Dhanem's pipes and the prostitutes he had brought from the town. Whores were held in high regard in Rhanesia, and it was not considered an untoward way to make a living.

 The only shame in prostitution was fetching a low price and Misankyte could imagine that these men and women had cost the lord a good penny. They danced unlike anything Misankyte had ever seen before, flowing and undulating like the grasses that grew in the rhanesian rivers, and drank freely from the guests' cups, copulating with men and women alike. 



Their dark skins glistened with oil in the light of the fire that burned in a pillared confine on the terrace. Misankyte looked on with a curiosity unhinged by the now fading tremors of the smoke and the drink as two courtesans coupled on floor in front of her. She had never embraced a lover, more by circumstance than by choice. 

Although she was very beautiful, few boys had dared approach her at home, afraid of angering her father. In Rhanesia she had never had the time nor the desire to find a companion.



"They are beautiful, are they not?" Lady Chumen walked up to Misankyte, a heavy-looking flagon in her hand, and sat down against the adjacent baluster. She filled Misankyte's cup. Misankyte drank before she answered with a nod. The two dark lovers were indeed beautiful. 

They moved as if though the act of love making was in itself a dance, in perfect synchrony with the pulse of a drum played by another. The woman's long hair fell softly over the man's hands as he reached up towards her breasts, as if to find purchase in his climactic climb. 

His back arched and a deep inhalation sent his chest reaching for the heavens with the unbridled yearning of a first flower breaking through a sheet of snow.



 His hands fell slowly from her breasts, following the accented curves of her waist and she drew her breath loudly. Her body was shaking erratically, muscles dancing under her taut skin. Misankyte felt a familiar heat grow inside her.

"They are mine, you know."

"What are their names?"



Lady Chumen smiled mysteriously. "The boy is Qiram."

His back had sunken back to the marble floor but he still breathed heavily. His chest, glistening with beads of sweat and oil, rose and fell like waves. 

The woman leaned down to kiss him and he embraced her trembling lower lip between his own. They rolled over to their sides, revealing the woman's beautifully carved curves in a stark silhouette against the light of the fire.

"And who is the girl?" The question broke out of her mouth with an eagerness.

Lady Chumen's smile turned mischievous. "Do you like her?" Her eyes were exploring Misankyte.

"They are both very beautiful, my lady."



Approval flared across Lady Chumen's face. Misankyte saw that her answer had pleased the lady, but she was not sure that she understood why.

"The girl's name is Mata," the Lady said and rose to her feet. "And I insist that I introduce you to them." She reached out her hand to offer Misankyte support.

Misankyte hesitated before she accepted the hand and rose slowly to her feet. The lingering effects of the wine made the motion feel smooth and easy. 



Chumen called for the two courtesans and they slowly sat up and stretched out their backs before helping each other to their feet. 

They didn't dress. When they reached Lady Chumen they knelt and she caressed their faces lovingly before handing them each a blanket to cover themselves.

"You did well, my statues. Please, rise."



"Thank you, mistress." The courtesans had responded in a well-rehearsed unison and graciously risen to face Misankyte. 

They looked her in the eyes with confidence and curiosity as they wrapped their cloths around their waists, leaving their pearled upper bodies naked. 

Mata wore a long necklace made of polished beads of dark malozhe wood that fell between her full breasts. They were much larger than Misankyte's.

"I would like to introduce you to my new friend, the future lady of this estate." Lady Chumen took a step back, taking a slight bow. ]]}
